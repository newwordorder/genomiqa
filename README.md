- [x] On home page please change the image to an Asian or European Female - also this was going to scroll through?

- [x] Learn more links do not work on the "what we analyse page"

- [x] Please include the attached clinical papers to down load from the resources page

- [x] On the for doctors and pathologists page - you can remove the consent form button - as this is now combined with the order form.

- [x] On the "genomic analysis" page - Beside the graph - "benefit" is spelled incorrectly - also the graph needs to be adjusted for the 86%

> NGS check page - images need to be added for the various modes

> FAQ's - can you amend "what methodology is used for analysis"

> Artificial intelligence and Max Kelsen page - read more about max Kelsen does not work

> As we have a gulf Q4 order form and a CapeQ4 order form do we need two options for the order form button?

> There is not an order form for insights Q4 - so we should have a note to say contact us for information on pricing and process?

> Also please make the current two brochures we have finalised available as PDF downloads from the relevant product and resources pages.
